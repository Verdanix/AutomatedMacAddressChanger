# Automated MAC Address Changer
Wifi providers normally "block" your device from accessing the internet with your MAC address

When someone blocks internet access to your device, it can be super annoying especially if you need to do homework at an ungodly time of day.

Luckily for you, I have just the solution (for Linux users only)

Normally if you go into settings and change it, you are still blocked from accessing the wifi. With this script you can change it, efficiently by using the `ip link` Linux command.

## To Run:
`pythnon3 script.py`
